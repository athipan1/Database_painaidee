# CI/CD Pipeline Fixes Summary

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Dependency Conflicts in Python Packages
**Problem**: Potential conflicts between dependencies, especially around lines 21-25 of requirements.txt
**Solution**: 
- Added explicit version constraints for matplotlib (`>=3.5.0,<3.11.0`)
- Added version constraints for seaborn (`>=0.11.0,<0.14.0`) 
- Added numpy version pinning (`>=1.20.0,<2.0.0`) to prevent numpy 2.x compatibility issues
- Added pandas pinning (`>=1.5.0,<2.2.0`) to ensure compatibility with numpy versions
- These changes prevent version resolution conflicts during pip install

### 2. PostgreSQL Role Configuration
**Problem**: PostgreSQL database errors related to role "root" not existing
**Solution**:
- Added `POSTGRES_INITDB_ARGS` to PostgreSQL service configuration for proper authentication setup
- Added PostgreSQL client tools installation step in workflow
- Added database connection verification step that waits for PostgreSQL to be ready
- Added fallback database creation logic to handle edge cases
- These changes ensure the PostgreSQL service starts correctly with the expected "testuser" role

### 3. Redis Memory Overcommit Warning
**Problem**: Redis warnings about memory overcommit not being enabled, potentially causing background save failures
**Solution**:
- Added `--sysctl vm.overcommit_memory=1` to Redis service options
- Added system-level memory overcommit configuration step in workflow
- Added Redis environment variables for better configuration
- These changes prevent Redis memory-related warnings and potential failures

## Files Modified

### 1. `requirements.txt`
```diff
- matplotlib>=3.5.0
- seaborn>=0.11.0
+ matplotlib>=3.5.0,<3.11.0
+ seaborn>=0.11.0,<0.14.0
+ # Fix potential numpy version conflicts
+ numpy>=1.20.0,<2.0.0
+ # Pin pandas to avoid compatibility issues with numpy
+ pandas>=1.5.0,<2.2.0
```

### 2. `.github/workflows/docker-build-push.yml`
- Enhanced PostgreSQL service configuration with proper initialization arguments
- Enhanced Redis service configuration with memory overcommit settings
- Added system configuration step for Redis memory overcommit
- Added PostgreSQL client tools installation
- Added database connection verification with fallback handling

## Testing
- Created verification script to test all fixes
- Validated YAML syntax and structure
- Confirmed dependency compatibility improvements
- Verified PostgreSQL and Redis configurations are properly set

## Benefits
1. **Dependency Stability**: Version constraints prevent unexpected breaking changes from newer package versions
2. **Database Reliability**: Enhanced PostgreSQL setup ensures consistent database initialization
3. **Redis Performance**: Memory overcommit configuration prevents Redis warnings and potential save failures
4. **CI/CD Robustness**: Added verification steps make the pipeline more resilient to environment variations

These minimal changes address the core issues while maintaining backward compatibility and following best practices for CI/CD pipeline configuration.
